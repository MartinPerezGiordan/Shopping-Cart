# React Shopping Page Project

Welcome to my React Shopping Page project! This project was developed as part of The Odin Project, a self-paced, open-source curriculum for learning web development.

## Overview

The goal of this project was to create a simple shopping page that displays various goods. I implemented key concepts such as fetching data from an API, client-side routing, lifting state up, and utilizing the useEffect and useState hooks in React.

## Project Features

- **Fetching from an API:** I used the [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/) to retrieve data about different products. The application fetches the product data and displays it dynamically on the page.

- **Client-side Routing:** React Router was implemented for seamless navigation between different sections of the shopping page. This enhances the user experience by allowing them to explore various product categories effortlessly.

- **Lifting State Up:** I employed the concept of lifting state up to manage and share the state among different components. This ensures a consistent and synchronized user interface across the application.

- **useEffect and useState Hooks:** The useEffect hook was utilized to fetch data when the component mounts, ensuring that the data is available when rendering. The useState hook was used to manage the application's state dynamically.

## Live Demo

You can check out the live demo of the project [here](https://shopping-cart-mpg.netlify.app/).

## Project Structure

- **src/components:** Contains individual React components used to build the shopping page.
- **src/pages:** Includes different page components for client-side routing.
- **src/services:** Houses utility functions for fetching data from the API.
